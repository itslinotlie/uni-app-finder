###### Designed by @itslinotlie

The 2nd rendition of the ICS4U group project series. The goal of the project is to match students to their ideal Engineering Unversity(s) in Ontario. Each group member is responsible for designing and implementing a unique matching method, whether by the means of a survey or visually displaying the geolocations of the universites. Everyone contributed to the project together, including, but not limited to, user login, look & feel, and data collection.

## My Major Contributions

### Introducing Git

A typical high-school group project usually consists of many files being shared over Google Drive. I've even seen people transfer code through Google Docs... Needless to say, this is very inefficient compared to using Git. I introduced and integrated Git into our workflow by creating the above video. Initially, there was a large learning curve with using the terminal and learning the syntax of Git. However, over the course of a week, everyone was accustomed to adding+commiting their changes and creating a pull request to merge their changes.
